PairUs is a web and mobile application developed to help individuals on a team come together based on shared interest and availability. Users can set their availability, create and select topics they wish to pair on, and view and select people they wish to pair with that match their availability and topics. On the mobile app, users are able to view potential pair matches one at a time and either swipe left to reject the time slot or swipe right to accept it. If both users swipe right on the same time slot then a match is created and each user receives an email with the details for setting up their meeting. The target users are students and coworkers who need to set up pairing sessions or schedule meetings.

The web app involves a Rails back end with an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript front end, while the mobile app is written in Swift. The database includes a schema that manages relationships between users, groups, topics, availabilities, and potential pair matches. The app utilizes an algorithm that matches people based on availability and topics to pair on so that they can be displayed to the user.
